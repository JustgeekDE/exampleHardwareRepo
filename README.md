# exampleHardwareRepo
This is a simple example project to try out [scoville](https://github.com/JustgeekDE/scoville).

The example projects can be found in the 'hardware' repository, the tests in 'test'. To run the tests you can use `./runTests simulationTests` for the simulation and `./runTests hardwareTests` to test against acutal hardware implementations.

The tests are executed in a virtual environment and use the latest version of scoville from the git master.
